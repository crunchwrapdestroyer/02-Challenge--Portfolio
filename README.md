[My Portfolio](https://crunchwrapdestroyer.github.io/02-Challenge--Portfolio/)

In this project I created a web page portfolio for my future projects to present my works to employers and associates. I included a nav bar section with links that lead to their corresponding sections in the webpage, as well as flex boxes for each project that lead to the external links of my deployed applications.
